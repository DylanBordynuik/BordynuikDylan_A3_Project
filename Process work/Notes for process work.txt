Idea 1: make a meteor dodging game using assignment 2 as a basis

Having random positions and arrays of objects seemed really complicated for the limited time I left for myself

Went back to the drawing board and decided to go to option 2

Idea 2: Clone an existing game

I settled on the first example game given in the instructions: Google's "T-Rex"

A game with a single input, and increasing difficulty.
